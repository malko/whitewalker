# WhiteWalker
White walker is a front-end for automated end to end testing. It can use various test runner adapters like [nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) or [protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) for example.

for ease of deployement see side project [whitewalker-skeleton-folder](https://github.com/malko/whitewalker-skeleton-folder).

This is still a work in progress so use it at your own risk and be indulgent for the lack of documentation.
