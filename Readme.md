White Walker is an automated nightwatch testing front-end

this is a work in progress so don't use it for now !

**todo**
- [x] read available environments from nightwatch.json
- [x] allow running specific environment
- [x] get initial test data from json cache and/or xml reports
- [x] cache tests data list to json file
- [x] send all tests data to index and remove server side template parsing
- [ ] WONT DO read and send xml reports instead of nightwatch command output (or allow both)
- [ ] allow screenshots viewing
- [x] add a git update button (updating the test directory)
- [-] add a run all tests button => make it work as intented
- [ ] allow running all environment at once
- [x] use websockets for live updates
