White Walker is an automated nightwatch testing front-end

this is a work in progress so don't use it for now !

**todo**
- [ ] read available environments from nightwatch.json
- [ ] allow running specific environment
- [ ] allow running all environment
- [ ] get initial test data from json cache and/or xml reports
- [ ] cache tests data list to json file
- [ ] send all tests data to index and remove server side template parsing
- [ ] read and send xml reports instead of nightwatch command output (or allow both)
- [ ] allow screenshots viewing
- [ ] add a git update button (updating the test directory)
- [ ] add a run all tests button
- [ ] use websockets for live updates
