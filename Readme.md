White Walker is an automated nightwatch testing front-end

this is a work in progress so don't use it for now !

**todo**
- [x] add a git update button (updating the test directory)
- [x] display git button only if present (propose git init eventually)
- [-] display report
- [x] better show/hide elements
- [ ] allow screenshots viewing
